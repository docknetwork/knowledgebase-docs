# Follow W3C Standards

[World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) (W3C) is an international organization that develops standards for the World Wide Web that define how web pages are structured and how they should behave, making it possible for computers to communicate with one another.&#x20;

Dock’s decentralized identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credential technology follow W3C’s standards:

* [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
* [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](http://w3.org/TR/did-core/)

On July 19, 2022, W3C announced that Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 is now an [official Web standard](https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec.html.en).&#x20;

These specifications are important because they provide a way to store digital identities and credentials in a secure and decentralized way. By using these standards, we can create a more secure and privacy-preserving internet and make it easier to share verifiable credentials across different systems and organizations.

W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. Their mission is "to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."\
