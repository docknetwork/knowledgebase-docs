# Sub-accounts

Sub-accounts allow Truvera's  customers to segregate their data within the Truvera platform based on their own customers. Each sub-account can have its own keys, organization profiles, credential designs and verification templates conveniently organized to help with tracking and auditing of the activity performed by each.

In order to easier manage sub-account assets [Ecosystem Tools](../../truvera-api/ecosystem-tools/) can be used.

Sub-accounts can be created and managed in the Truvera Workspace. Sub-accounts menu is located in the Team settings.

You can create new sub-accounts, edit and delete them from this menu. For any other operation related to the sub-account (creating a DID, issuing credential etc.) you will need to take over that sub-account and do the actions in the account. You can take over the subaccount and use it by clicking on it a message will be displayed that the account is being changed and you will see a new account on the profile menu on the top of the screen.
