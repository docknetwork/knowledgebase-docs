# Data retention policies

Every team can customize their data retention policies based on specific requirements. Truvera promotes user privacy and data management best practices by minimizing stored data and empowering customers with flexible retention controls. You can now configure:

* **Verification Data Retention Policy**: Credential presentation data from completed verification requests will be automatically deleted after the selected time. Default is 72 hours, with a 1 hour minimum retention time.
* **Verification Requests Retention Policy**: Verification request data (except for verification ID) will be automatically deleted after the selected time. Default is 72 hours, with a 1 hour minimum retention time.
* **Credential Offers Retention Policy**: Unclaimed credential offers will be automatically deleted after the selected time. Default is 72 hours, with a 1 hour minimum retention time.
* **Credentials Retention Policy**: All except persisted credentials will be automatically deleted after the selected time. Default is infinite, with a 1 hour minimum retention time.

These granular settings give you complete control over your data lifecycle while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.

There is an option to store subject reference ID, that shows up on the credential view table and can be useful for filtering the credentials. The storing of it is optional as it may contain PII and is not suitable for all use cases.
