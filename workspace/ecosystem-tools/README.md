# Ecosystem Tools

Verifiable credentials have an advantage over physical documents, because they cannot be forged. However, there is still a fraud risk if a credential is issued by someone that has no authority to do so.

How can a verifier be sure that the credential came from an authorized issuer? And vice-versa, how can a credential holder know which verifiers are trustworthy and that it is okay to share their credentials with them? Ecosystem Tools is a solution to answer this problem.

## What is an Ecosystem?

\
Ecosystem is a network of trusted digital identity issuers and verifiers. It uses a trust registry an on-chain list that contains information on who is authorized and trusted to issue or verify credentials in a particular ecosystem and which credential schemas they can issue and verify.&#x20;

Ecosystems are governed by trust frameworks, a set of operating rules that participants of the ecosystem must follow.

## Why use Ecosystem Tools?

A trust ecosystem helps organizations to simplify everyday interactions and have confidence to allow other organizations or people to interact and share fraud-proof and digitally verifiable data.

Governing Authority could register as an Ecosystem Admin in Truvera Workspace where they can establish a Trusted Brand, communicate rules for participation in a Governance Framework, and administer the ecosystem.

By having an on-chain trust registry, credential verifiers do not need to manage a list of valid issuers and holders know which verifiers they can trust to share their credentials with. They only need to trust one Ecosystem administrator.
