# Revoking Credentials

If you need to make a credential invalid you can revoke it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To make a credential revocable, you need to select [Credential Revocation](issue-verifiable-credentials/#h\_e26a4957df) when issuing credentials. If the revocation was not selected upon creation the credential can never be revoked and will always be verifiable.
{% endhint %}

Select Credentials, the credential(s) you want to revoke to make it invalid, and select Revoke. You can revoke one credential at a time.
