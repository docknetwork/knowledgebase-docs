# Service Downtime: Test Data Migration on January 28

Please be informed  about a planned test data migration as we transition from the Dock blockchain to the cheqd blockchain. While we work on this upgrade, there may be a brief disruption to our services.

Migration Window:\
\
🗓 Date: January 28, 2025\
⏰ Time: 19:00 UTC – 22:00 UTC

What This Means for You:

* ✅ You can still add new resources (e.g., DIDs, schemas, or verification templates).
* ⚠️ Existing resources may temporarily fail to load or verify.
* 🛠 Full service will resume as soon as the migration is complete.

Why This Matters:\
This migration from the Dock blockchain to the cheqd blockchain enhances our infrastructure, ensuring a more robust and scalable platform for your needs.

If you experience any issues outside this window or have any questions, please let us know via support@dock.io

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we make these improvements.
