# Custom branded distribution emails

To enable our customers to create a streamlined user experience we enable them to customize the credential distribution emails.

To have your logo and company name appear on the email, you will need to update the relevant Organization profile with the logo and Public Name. It will then be used to brand the credential distribution email.
