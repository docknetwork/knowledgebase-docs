In Credential attributes, add the type of information you want to appear on the schema. You can do this in two ways:

a) By manually setting up what kind information you want to appear

b) Importing an existing credential template from another source

:information\_source: You don’t need to add an Issue Date and Expiry Date field because these fields will automatically appear on all templates.

Once you’ve added all the fields, select Publish at the top and on the message that appears afterwards.

The new credential schema is created. If you add more schemas they will all be listed on this page when you select Schemas from the menu.

You can also see your new credential templates added with the pre-built templates. So whenever you issue a credential, you will be able to choose a template from this list.

Select Preview to see the fields that you set up on your custom credential template.

The Issue Date and Expiration Date are default fields that will appear on every template if you create the template manually.

### Add Credential Fields by Importing an Existing Credential Schema <a href="#h_b163952b0c" id="h_b163952b0c"></a>

You can import an existing credential schema into Dock. For example you can find some credential templates here: [https://ui.schema.affinidi.com/schemas](https://ui.schema.affinidi.com/schemas).

Select a template like EmploymentVC for example

Click on the template to see the data fields

Copy the URL by clicking on Issue VC with this schema and clicking on the copy icon

Paste the URL in the Credential Template and select Import Schema

Double check to make sure that the format for the drop down menus for each field is selected. Add and remove whatever fields you want. Select Publish once this is done.

Now you can see the imported credential on the template list.
