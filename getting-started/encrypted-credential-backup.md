# Encrypted credential backup

If issuers want to securely store the credentials as a backup, they have an option to do so by “persisting” the credentials. This encrypts the credentials and stores them on our servers that are located in the US and are powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Because the credential information is encrypted, Dock can’t access the information to ensure data privacy and security. ​ An encrypted document is a file that has been scrambled in a way that makes it unreadable to anyone who does not have the right key or password to decode it.
