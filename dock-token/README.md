# ðŸª™ DOCK Token

DOCK is the native token of Dockâ€™s blockchain network that is used to transact, incentivize, and vote in its Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifier ecosystem.

The Dock network will be migrating its functionality and all tokens to the cheqd blockchain. This migration will allow Dock to leverage cheqdâ€™s advanced infrastructure and bring enhanced value to both ecosystems. Existing $DOCK tokens will be converted into $CHEQ tokens, ensuring a smooth transition for all token holders. Official announcements is [available here](https://www.dock.io/post/dock-and-cheqd-form-alliance-to-accelerate-global-adoption-of-decentralized-id).
