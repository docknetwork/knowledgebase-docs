# Migration Terms and Conditions

These Terms of Use (hereinafter the "Terms of Use") shall set forth the terms and conditions that govern your participation in the Dock to Cheqd Token Migration Application (hereinafter the "Migration Application").

Please read these Terms of Service (this “Agreement”) carefully. By requesting to migrate your Dock tokens to the Cheqd network (as defined below), you acknowledge and consent to this Agreement.

This Agreement is between you (the “User” and collectively with others using the Migration Application, the “Users”) and the Dock Association, an Association organized under the Laws of Switzerland (“Association”, “Dock”, or “we,” “our” or “us” and together with you, the “Parties”). This agreement governs your use of (including any access to) Dock’s website, currently located at www.dock.io, web applications including the migration portal provided at www.fe.dock.io, decentralized applications, and other related services (collectively referred to as the “Site”).&#x20;

References to "Cheqd" in this Agreement are to the Cheqd Foundation, which oversees the Cheqd network and the CHEQ token, with its website at [https://cheqd.io](https://cheqd.io).

\


#### Migration Process Overview

The token migration process allows you to exchange Dock tokens, native to the Substrate-based Dock blockchain, for Cheqd tokens. The following steps summarize the token migration process:\


1. Access the Migration Application available at www.fe.dock.io and choose the Dock account holding your DOCK tokens.
2. Connect your Cheqd account either via Leap/Keplr wallet or by manually entering your Cheqd account details.\

3. Carefully read the terms and conditions of the migration, then click Submit to finalize your request.\

4. Once your migration request is submitted, your DOCK tokens will be permanently burned. You will then receive the equivalent amount of CHEQ tokens, calculated based on the Swap Ratio. It may take up to a few days to receive the CHEQ tokens in your Cheqd account.

By participating in the Migration Application or using the Site or Services (as defined below), you agree to the terms of this Agreement. Dock reserves the right to update or modify this Agreement at its sole discretion, and such changes will be effective as specified in Section 3 below.
