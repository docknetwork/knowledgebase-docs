# Dock Token Migration

The Dock network will be migrating its functionality and all tokens to the cheqd blockchain. This migration will allow Dock to leverage cheqdâ€™s advanced infrastructure and bring enhanced value to both ecosystems. Existing $DOCK tokens will be converted into $CHEQ tokens, ensuring a smooth transition for all token holders. Official announcements is [available here](https://www.dock.io/post/dock-and-cheqd-form-alliance-to-accelerate-global-adoption-of-decentralized-id).

Complete your $DOCK token migration to $CHEQ by **February 2025** to ensure a smooth transition. Migration Terms and Conditions can be found here.
