# Dock Token Migration

Dock has officially completed the token migration as of March 31, 2021. Any questions related to the token migration can be sent to support@dock.io.

During the migration, Dock tokens were migrated from the original ERC20 token (which has now been deprecated) to a native token that is running on the Dock mainnet blockchain. Learn more about the token migration in our [blog post](https://blog.dock.io/the-dock-token-migration-is-now-complete/).
