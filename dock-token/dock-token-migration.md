# Dock Token Migration

The Dock network will be migrating its functionality and all tokens to the cheqd blockchain. This migration will allow Dock to leverage cheqdâ€™s advanced infrastructure and bring enhanced value to both ecosystems. Existing $DOCK tokens will be converted into $CHEQ tokens, ensuring a smooth transition for all token holders. Official announcements is [available here](https://www.dock.io/post/dock-and-cheqd-form-alliance-to-accelerate-global-adoption-of-decentralized-id).

[Migration Tems and Conditions can be found here](dock-token-migration/migration-terms-and-conditions.md).

## Instructions for $DOCK token holders

Before starting the migration the process make sure you have a wallet that can hold $CHEQ. If you do not, [see instructions on how to set one up.](https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets/setup-leap-wallet)

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using Leap wallet, because it has full support on desktop, browser and mobile, but you can also use a Keplr wallet if you already have one.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Migration can only be done from the [Dock browser-based wallet](https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/wallets-and-account-creation#dock-polkadot-js-app). <mark style="background-color:red;">ADD A LINK TO THE MIGRATION PAGE</mark>

Token holders that use Dock Wallet App or Nova Wallet can add their accounts to the browser wallet by [following these steps.](dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet.md)

To migrate your $DOCK tokens

1. Select your Dock account. If it isn't yet added, then follow [these instructions.](https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet)
2. Connect your cheqd wallet or enter your cheqd account manually. Connecting a Leap wallet will allow us to confirm that the tokens are going to the cheqd account that you control.&#x20;
3. Accep T\&Cs and click Submit
4. Authorize the transaction by entering your account password. Click **Sign & Submit**

The entire amount of the account will be migrated at once. After the migration request is submitted your $DOCK tokens will be burnt and you will be sent the converted CHEQD amount with **Swap Ratio:** 18.5178 $DOCK to 1 $CHEQ. The migration will take up to 1-2 business days to complete, after that the converted $CHEQ amount will be available in the indicated cheqd wallet.

The migration service will only be available until **February 28, 2025.**

Please follow these instructions carefully and contact our team with any questions at [support@dock.io](mailto:support@dock.io).
