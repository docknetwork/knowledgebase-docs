# Dock Token Migration

Dock has officially completed the ERC20 token migration as of March 31, 2021. During the migration, Dock tokens were migrated from the original ERC20 token (which has now been deprecated) to a native DOCK token that is running on the Dock mainnet blockchain. Learn more about the token migration in our [blog post](https://blog.dock.io/the-dock-token-migration-is-now-complete/).
