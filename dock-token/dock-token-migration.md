# Dock Token Migration

The Dock network will be migrating its functionality and all tokens to the cheqd blockchain. This migration will allow Dock to leverage cheqd’s advanced infrastructure and bring enhanced value to both ecosystems. Existing $DOCK tokens will be converted into $CHEQ tokens, ensuring a smooth transition for all token holders. Official announcements is [available here](https://www.dock.io/post/dock-and-cheqd-form-alliance-to-accelerate-global-adoption-of-decentralized-id).

[Migration Tems and Conditions can be found here](dock-token-migration/migration-terms-and-conditions.md).

## Instructions for $DOCK token holders

Before starting the migration the process make sure you have a wallet that can hold $CHEQ. If you do not, [see instructions on how to set one up.](https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets/setup-leap-wallet)

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using Leap wallet, because it has full support on desktop, browser and mobile, but you can also use a Keplr wallet if you already have one.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Migration can only be done from the [Dock browser-based wallet](https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/wallets-and-account-creation#dock-polkadot-js-app). <mark style="background-color:red;">ADD A LINK TO THE MIGRATION PAGE</mark>

Token holders that use Dock Wallet App or Nova Wallet can add their accounts to the browser wallet by [following these steps.](dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your $DOCK tokens are currently on an exchange, you’ll need to withdraw them to a Dock wallet to complete the token migration, as it can only be done from an address you own. [Follow our guide on creating a Dock wallet account to get started](https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/wallets-and-account-creation#to-create-a-new-account). We are actively working with exchanges to allow them to handle the migration on behalf of users, and we’ll publish a list of participating exchanges as soon as it’s available.
{% endhint %}

To migrate your $DOCK tokens

1. Select your Dock account. If it isn't yet added, then follow [these instructions.](https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet)
2. Connect your cheqd wallet or enter your cheqd account manually. Connecting a Leap wallet will allow us to confirm that the tokens are going to the cheqd account that you control.&#x20;
3. Accep T\&Cs and click Submit
4. Authorize the transaction by entering your account password. Click **Sign & Submit**

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the account has **locked or staked** funds they will need to be [unbonded](https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/staking/how-to-unbond-and-rebond) to migrate.
{% endhint %}

The entire amount of the account will be migrated at once. After the migration request is submitted your $DOCK tokens will be burnt and you will be sent the converted CHEQD amount with **Swap Ratio:** 18.5178 $DOCK to 1 $CHEQ. The migration will take up to 1-2 business days to complete, after that the converted $CHEQ amount will be available in the indicated cheqd wallet.

The migration service will only be available until **March 15, 2025.**

Please follow these instructions carefully and contact our team with any questions at [support@dock.io](mailto:support@dock.io).
