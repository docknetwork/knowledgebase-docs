# Ecosystems (Trust Registries)

Verifiable credentials have an advantage over physical documents, because they cannot be forged. However, there is still a fraud risk if a credential is issued by someone that has no authority to do so.&#x20;

How can a verifier be sure that the credential came from an authorized issuer? And vice-versa, how can a credential holder know which verifiers are trustworthy and that it is okay to share their credentials with them? A trust registry is a solution to answer this problem.

## What is a Trust Registry?

\
A trust registry is an on-chain list that contains information on who is authorized and trusted to issue or verify credentials in a particular ecosystem and which credential schemas they can issue and verify.  Trust registries are governed by trust frameworks, a set of operating rules that participants of the ecosystem must follow.

## Why use a Trust Registry?

By having an  trust registry, credential verifiers do not need to manage a list of valid issuers and holders know which verifiers they can trust to share their credentials with. They only need to trust one Ecosystem administrator.
