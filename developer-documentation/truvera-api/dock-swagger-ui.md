# Dock Swagger UI

Dock Swagger UI generates interactive API documentation to try out the API calls directly in any browser. Use our [Swagger UI](https://swagger.api.dock.io/) to execute the API calls quickly:

* Login to [Dock Certs](https://certs.dock.io/).
* Enable the **Test mode** in Dock Certs to benefit from unlimited transactions.
* Create your first API key by clicking **'Create API key'**. Copy and Save it.
* Use this key to **'Authorize'** into the Swagger UI.
