# Interoperability

Dock believes that credentials are most useful when they are interoperable across service providers. Our W3C compliant credential format is designed for maximum interoperability. Our anonymous credential format adheres to many W3C standards, but are designed for maximum privacy protection. We also leverage standards from OpenID, IETF, DIF, and related organizations.
