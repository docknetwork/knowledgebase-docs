### Restoring from backup

When setting up a new Truvera wallet:

2. Select your previously downloaded JSON backup file
3. Enter the password you created during the backup process
4. Your wallet will be restored with all previous data

### Important notes

* Store your backup file in a secure location
* Keep your backup password safe and separate from the backup file
* Consider creating multiple backup copies stored in different secure locations
* Test your backup by attempting a restore on a secondary device to ensure it works properly
