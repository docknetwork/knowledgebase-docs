# Publishing in app stores

Once the wallet is [configured](../configuration/) and you have built a test application, you can distribute the wallet by enrolling as a publisher in the app store of your choice. By directly managing the distribution of your application, you will maintain a direct relationship with your users. While we don't directly manage your listing with 3rd party app stores, [our support team](../../../support/support-services.md#contacting-support) can help with common problems that may arise.
