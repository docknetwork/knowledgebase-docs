# Truvera White-Label Wallet

When development speed is a priority, Truvera offers a white-label wallet solution that gives you all the capabilities of the [Truvera Mobile Wallet applications](../truvera-mobile-wallet/) but with your custom branding. If you don’t have an existing app, Truvera's White-Label Wallet is the best option. It’s a ready-made, tested solution that saves you the time and money of building a wallet from scratch. In addition, it is easier to maintain because the team at Truvera takes care of automatic wallet updates.

The white-label wallet offering allows you to:

* Customize the wallet with your brand identity.
* Only activate the features you need with composable feature sets.
* Manage your own App Store profile and relationships with users.
* Put users in control of their data.

You can see the technical implementation steps [here](configuration/).
