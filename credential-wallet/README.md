# Credential wallet

Truvera's Credential Wallet technology provides a secure, flexible solution for managing and sharing verifiable credentials across platforms. With the ability to store tamper-proof credentials, the wallet ensures that users can easily share their information for verification, while maintaining full control over their data.&#x20;

To help businesses integrate the wallet, Truvera offers several flexible deployment options:

### Mobile wallet SDK

Truvera's mobile SDK allows you to quickly embed the wallet into your app or your clients’ apps. The SDK is built with a modular feature set, so you can activate only the functionalities you need, making it adaptable to various use cases. With secure, local data storage, users maintain full control of their credentials while ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection standards. This is the best option when you want to maximize user control of their data, which is important for knowledgeable users.

You can see the technical implementation steps [here](../developer-documentation/wallet-sdk/).

### Cloud wallet

Truvera also offers a cloud-based wallet for those who want to reduce barriers to adoption by a non-technical user. The cloud wallet provides secure, encrypted storage of credentials, allowing users to access their digital IDs anytime, anywhere. This solution is ideal for organizations that require scalable, cloud-based credential management.

### White-label wallet

When development speed is a priority , Truvera offers a white-label wallet solution. If you don’t have an existing app, Truvera's White Label Wallet is the best option.
