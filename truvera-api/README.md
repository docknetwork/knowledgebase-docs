# Truvera API

The Truvera API allows you to issue, verify and revoke verifiable credentials, manage DIDs and interact with a blockchain. Truvera integrates industry-leading standards for verifiable credentials, allowing it to interoperate with other identity technologies. We provide a range of open-source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/docknetwork) that can be used alongside the API.

Primary features include:

* Easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke/unrevoke verifiable credentials.
* Create and manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
* Create and assign schemas to credentials for compliance.
* Work seamlessly across platforms with Truvera's standards-compliant, interoperable solutions.
* Create a network of trusted issuers and verifiers using Ecosystem Tools.
* Motivate issuers by enabling credential monetization.
