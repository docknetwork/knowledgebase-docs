# Truvera API

The Dock Certs API allows you to issue, verify and revoke verifiable credentials, manage DIDs and interact with the Dock blockchain. Dock integrates industry-leading World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and VCDM standards, allowing it to interoperate with other open source technologies. We provide a range of open-source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/docknetwork) that can be used alongside the API. Primary features include:

* Easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke/unrevoke verifiable credentials.
* Create and manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
* Drop anchors on the blockchain for better validation and security.
* Create and assign schemas to credentials for compliance.
* Harness the security of the Dock blockchain, a network run by 50 independent validators.
* Work seamlessly across platforms with Dockâ€™s standards-compliant, interoperable solutions.

In addition to the code samples shown in these docs, we have provided various code samples for the common requests that you can easily access [here](https://github.com/docknetwork/api-samples).

We also offer a free trial, testnet sandboxing and fair monthly pricing. Sign up and [start issuing credentials with Dock Certs](https://certs.dock.io/). Please read our [Terms of Service](https://www.dock.io/terms-of-service) before using Dock Certs.
