# Sample Postman Collections

Download and use our [Postman Collections](https://github.com/docknetwork/knowledgebase-docs/tree/main/Postman_collections) to experiment with basic API flows:

* Download Postman [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
* Download our [API collection here](https://github.com/docknetwork/knowledgebase-docs/tree/main/Postman_collections).
* Import Truvera Collection in Postman with our API collection that you have downloaded previously. For the detailed instructions to import the json file, please refer [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/).
* Create a new environment in Postman. For the detailed instruction to create a new environment, please refer [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/).
* In your new Postman environment, you need to create two new `ApiKey` and `BaseUrl` variables. Please refer [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) for the instructions to set the new variables.
* Login to [Truvera Workspace](https://truvera.io/).
* In your Truvera Workspace dashboard, click **Create API key** on the keys page to generate the key, copy and save it (make sure the test mode toggle is on).
* Set `ApiKey` initial and current values with the value that you generated in Truvera Workspace.
* Set `BaseUrl` initial and current values with [https://api-testnet.truvera.io](https://api-testnet.truvera.io)
