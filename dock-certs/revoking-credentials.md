# Revoking Credentials

If you need to make a credential invalid you can revoke it.

‚ùóFor a credential to be revocable you need to select [Credential Revocation ](https://help.dock.io/en/articles/8200914-issue-verifiable-credentials#h\_e26a4957df)when issuing credentials. If the revocation was not selected upon creation the credential can never be revoked and will always be verifiable.

Select Credentials, the credential(s) you want to revoke to make it invalid, and select Revoke. You can revoke one credential at a time.
