# Using Custom Branding for Emails

To enable our customers to create a more streamlined user experience we are introducing the ability to customize the credential distribution emails.

To have your logo and company name appear on the email, you will need to update the relevant Issuer profile with the logo and Public Name. It will then be used to brand the credential distribution email.

Add the recipient emails either manually or via spreadsheet import.

Make sure to select the same Issuer Profile when creating the credential.

When the credential email is received it will show Your Company name in the send in the format "Your Company name via Dock", it will have Your Logo on the top and will remove the Powered by Dock Certs logo at the bottom of the email.
