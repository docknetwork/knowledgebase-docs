# Monetizing Credentials

### What is Credential Monetization?

Dock has created a unique feature that allows setting a verification fee on credentials and introduces a new revenue stream that ecosystem administrator can leverage to motivate issuers to join their ecosystem. It converts credential issuance from expense to profit and is an important step in accelerating adoption of verifiable credentials by creating value for participating parties.&#x20;

### How does it work?

Dock's unprecedented technology utilises KVAC (Keyed Verification Anonymous Credential) to lock the credential making sure, that it can only be verified that a payment has been made.&#x20;

Ecosystem administrator sets a price for each schema and assigns it to participating issuers and verifiers.&#x20;

When a verifier is trying to verify a credential, they will be notified that this verification requires a fee. During the verification issuer provides an additional secret for the specific credential schema in order to unlock it. This is all done automatically within seconds during the verification process.&#x20;

Dock will track the verifications and provide detailed billing reports to the ecosystem administrators. Dock will charge a small percentage fee for each verification transaction based on the price set on the schema.
