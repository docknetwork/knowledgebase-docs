# Ecosystem Tools

### What are Ecosystem Tools?

Ecosystem Tools allow organizations to create a network of trusted digital identity issuers and verifiers through a user-friendly dashboard. A trust ecosystem helps organizations to simplify everyday interactions and have confidence to allow other organizations or people to interact and share fraud-proof and digitally verifiable data.

Governing Authority could register as an Ecosystem Admin in Dock Certs where they can establish a Trusted Brand, communicate rules for participation in a Governance Framework, and administer the ecosystem.
