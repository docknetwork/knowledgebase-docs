# Ecosystem set up

### Create an ecosystem

You can create an Ecosystem through the left side menu Ecosystem button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ecosystem Tools is an add-on feature. If you do not see it in your menu bar and want it enabled for your account please contact support@dock.io
{% endhint %}

First steps in creating your ecosystem is defining your brand. Ecosystem branding is important, it will be present on the credentials issued by the participants and verification templates for the verifiers. Having a clearly defined brand makes it easier for ecosystem participants to trust the ecosystem and have a unified experience from credential issuance, to storage and verification.

You will need to set the Ecosystem **Name**, **Description,** add an **Ecosystem URL, a** valid URL that links to a page outlining the advantages and key details of joining your ecosystem.

**Convener DID** will allow you to choose from an existing or add a new DID that will be the administrator of the ecosystem.&#x20;

Next step will allow you to set your Governance Framework document, that is used to communicate the rules and guidelines of the ecosystem to every stakeholder, ensuring clarity and consistency, which helps align all stakeholders on the processes surrounding issuance and verification.

### Invite a participant&#x20;

After the ecosystem is set up you can start inviting participants.

Ecosystem participants can be Issuers, Verifiers or both depending on their role in your ecosystem. You will be able to asign credential schemas based on the role of the participant.



* Create a schema +
* Invite an issuer +
* Assign the schema to the issuer +
* Invite a verifier +
* Assign the same schema to the verifier +
* Issue a credential to the wallet based on that schema
* See the ecosystem branding in the wallet
* Verify that credential, with ecosystem branding throughout the flow

### Invite Issuers and assign schemas

### Invite verifiers and share verification templates
