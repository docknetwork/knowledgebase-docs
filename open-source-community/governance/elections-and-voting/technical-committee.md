# Technical Committee

The technical committee can fast track governance proposals made by the Council. The current technical committee members can be seen at the URL [https://fe.dock.io/#/techcomm](https://fe.dock.io/#/techcomm). The image shows 3 technical committee members Dave, Eve, and Ferdie. Note that the images are for illustrative purposes and the name, address, member count might not match the network.

Council members can add new or remove existing technical committee members through simple majority voting, in the same way they do for Council members with a slight but important difference (described below). To look at the process, visit the Council section.

The rest of the process is the same as adding a member to the Council with the "Propose" -> "Vote" -> "Close" workflow.

The process to remove a member is similar, the image below shows Ferdie being removed from the committee.
