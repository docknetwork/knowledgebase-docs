# How to store DOCK

DOCK token is supported by several wallets listed below.

## Dock Mobile Wallet App

Store, send, and receive your DOCK tokens securely on your mobile device using the Dock Mobile wallet app, available on both Android and iPhone. The Dock mobile wallet allows you to control and manage your own private keys and tokens on your device without the involvement of any third party.

Download the App from the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dock-wallet/id1565227368) or Google [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dockapp).

## Nova Wallet App

‍[Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/) is a next-gen iOS/Android application for the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem. Nova Wallet supports over 80+ networks and hundreds of assets, Governance, NFTs, extensive DApp support (for both Substrate & EVM), Hardware Wallet Support, Crowdloans, and staking of assets.

**Cold Storage:** Nova Wallet's Polkadot Vault integration provides enhanced security for your DOCK tokens. This feature turns your separate, unused mobile device into a hardware wallet. Your keys are kept secure (i.e. offline) at all times, and transactions are signed in an air-gapped way via QR-codes. [See instruction on how to set up Parity Signer with Nova Wallet](https://docs.novawallet.io/nova-wallet-wiki/wallet-management/hardware-wallets/parity-signer).

## Dock Polkadot-JS App

Dock has forked and customized the well-tested, browser-based wallet that is also used for Polkadot. This is a browser-based application, so it is not as secure as using an offline option.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Consider storing your account in a signer such as a browser extension, hardware device, QR-capable phone wallet (non-connected) or desktop application for optimal account security.
{% endhint %}

Go to [https://fe.dock.io/#/accounts](https://fe.dock.io/#/accounts) and check the top left corner that you are on Dock’s mainnet. If not, then click on the network name, click on **Live Networks > Dock**, and click **Switch**.
