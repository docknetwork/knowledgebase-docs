# Trust Registry

## What is a trust registry

\
A trust registry is an on-chain list of relationships between issuers and verifiers. It simplifies the process of identifying which issuers and verifiers are trustworthy within a particular ecosystem.  These registries serve as secure repositories for identity information, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure its integrity and reliability.

## Why use a trust registry

Trust registries provide a robust solution to the challenges associated with identity management in the digital realm. They offer a secure and tamper-proof way to store and verify identity data, enhancing privacy, security, and trust among participants. [Dock's ecosystem](../../../dock-certs/ecosystem-tools/) exemplifies the power of trust registries in creating a network of trusted digital identity issuers and verifiers. Through user-friendly ecosystem tools, organizations can establish a network where they can confidently interact and share fraud-proof, digitally verifiable data.

One key feature of trust registries like Dock's ecosystem is their flexibility in accommodating various Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), not limited to did:dock. This allows for interoperability and compatibility with different identity standards and systems, ensuring inclusivity and scalability.
