# Operations

Once you have completed the Account, Identity, Bonding, and Session Keys setup, you can confirm that your validator is waiting to validate in the next area by checking that it appears here: [https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/waiting](https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/waiting)

In the next era, if a slot is available, your validator will join the validator set and be visible at [https://fe.dock.io/#/staking](https://fe.dock.io/#/staking).

**To** **stop being a validator** (including letting it chill), click the Stop button for your validator at [https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/actions](https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/actions).

**To stake additional tokens**, click the 3 dots for your validator [https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/actions](https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/actions) and click “Bond more funds”. This is also where you can change the controller, commission, or take other actions for your validator.

&#x20;**To check validator stats** such as points, slashes, etc. check the [Dock Node Frontend](https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/query) and enter your stash address\
